# PuzzleBox-A-virtual-scavenger-hunt-
Just for kicks. Since this is a scavenger hunt, I'll just let you figure out what it does?

Okay, maybe some hints: This is a whimsical jam of an Arduino controlled box lock (I'll leave you to figure out how exactly to install it; mine was cardboard and, well, a little flimsy...), some python video rendering for clues, and a hunt for an RFID key. The lock is a servo motor, the box talks through the LCD, some game tunes and flashes are implemented using a buzzer and LEDs. Videos rendered should be on your disc, and to go with these clues, you'll need cameos of Rome, London, and Egypt (yes, around the world but from home).

To play,
Step one: find the RFID key. Step two: Activate the box. Step 3: Run through a few brain teasers (clues are presented in videos + a question displayed on the LCD) where the answers are always in one or two digits (and may require some googling). Step 4: Retrieve your treasure.

The rest, I'll leave to you to figure out.

Bon Voyage!

P.s.: For whatever reason I only have the python half of the code and will add the Arduino half when I fish it out of wherever it is. Sorry.
